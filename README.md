# File-Manager

**File-Manager** is a graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to help users organize files within a specified directory. By selecting a folder path, the application identifies all available file types (e.g., `.txt`, `.png`, `.docx`) and allows users to choose which types to organize. It then creates corresponding folders for each selected file type and moves the respective files into these folders.

- **Automatic File Type Detection**: The application scans the chosen directory to identify all unique file extensions.
